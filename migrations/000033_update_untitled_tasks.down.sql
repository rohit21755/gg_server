-- Rollback migration: This migration updates tasks, so rollback is not applicable
-- The changes made are data updates, not schema changes
-- If you need to revert, you would need to restore from a backup
-- This file is kept for migration consistency

-- Note: There is no safe way to rollback data updates without a backup
-- This migration updates task titles and descriptions, which cannot be automatically reverted
